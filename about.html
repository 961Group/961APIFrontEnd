    <span class="col-6 text JustifyText">961API receives requests and responds in the form of XML format.
        When a request for an API is established, the server receives the parameters,
        analyzes them with data fetched from the database, then returns the data in form of XML tags holding the data inside,
        then the 3rd party application receives the response and converts it into variables associated with the language it’s written in.
